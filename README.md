# AIM:
To design a secure and attractive fake login page using HTML, CSS, and PHP, and to understand the working of form data handling in cybersecurity awareness projects.

#  Procedure:
Create an HTML page (index.html) for the login form.

Style the login page with modern CSS (glassmorphism and dark/light theme).

Write a PHP file (login.php) to capture and store form data into log.txt.

Run the project locally using XAMPP Apache Server.

Test the page on localhost.

Deploy the frontend part (HTML + CSS) to GitHub.

# Code:
I have the following files:

index.html → Frontend login page

login.php → Captures and saves the login details

log.txt → Gets created automatically when the form is submitted

Images → background-dark.jpg, background-light.jpg

# Output:
Modern login page in dark/light theme.

Fake form simulates login and stores the data into a file.
Data captured in log.txt 

# Result:
The project successfully simulates a login page with dark and light themes and captures user inputs into a log file, demonstrating basic phishing page creation and file handling in PHP.
